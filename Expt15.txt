15 . Write a program to implement following inheritance. Accept data for 5 persons and display the name of employee having salary greater than 5000. Class Name: Person Member variables: Name, age Class Name: Employee Member variables: Designation, salary.
class Person{
    String name;
    int age;
    Person(int age, String name) {
       this.name = name;
       this.age = age;
    }
}
class Employee extends Person{
    String designation;
    int salary;
    Employee(String designation, String name, int age, int salary) {
        super(age, name);
        this.designation = designation;
        this.salary = salary;
        if (salary>5000){
           System.out.println(name);
            }
      } 
    }
public class employeeSalary{
